# Mario Kart DS ItemSlotList.dat Editor

The only Mario Kart DS ItemSlotList.dat Editor on the market as of now!
Edits ItemSlotList.dat files responsible for item probability distribution, as specified in the table in [here](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_DS_item_probability_distributions).

Research made thanks to me being bored and the file on Tockdom's wiki about Mario Kart Wii [probability table distribution](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/ItemSlot.bin).

### Usage

Open up the .exe binary file, click *Load ItemSlotList.dat*, load up the file dumped from *MainRace.carc*, edit it in the application's window and export it using *Save ItemSlotList.dat*. Reimport the file to *MainRace.carc*, rebuild the ROM.

### Credits

- Ermelber for helping out with making the ItemSlotListDat.cs file comply with Mario Kart Toolbox format
